    harmless while SOLAR_EXPORT only ever occurred with a full battery
    (nothing left to charge anyway either way), but wrong once the DP can

        question, or the UI shows a hold for periods production releases and
        `_mode_display_fields` breaks its own no-fabrication contract.

        **Index p-1, not p.** `state_of_energy` is `combined_soe`, whose only

        `BatterySystemManager._create_updated_schedule`) -- `battery_soe_end`
        and `battery_soe_start` are distinct fields on `EnergyData`. So
        `state_of_energy[p]` is the SoE *leaving* period p, and the SoE
        *entering* it is index p-1. Reading index p directly would answer for
        the wrong period: at the boundary where the plan first reaches the

        `combined_soe[0]` is written as `current_soe` — an entering value. On a
        schedule re-optimized mid-day, index 0 is a historical period holding
        `battery_soe_end` like every other index, so the read is one period
        early there. Display-only and bounded to period 0: `get_period_settings`
        never writes hardware, and the live write path reads SoC directly. Left
        as-is rather than papered over, because the array has no entering value
        for period 0 to read — recording one is a change to
        `_create_updated_schedule`, not to this method.
